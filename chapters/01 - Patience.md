# 01 :: Patience

Reducing complexity
Is the essence of good design.
The ordering principle despises chaos—
Entropy must be _crushed_.

Disorder is the inevitable consequence
Of undue haste.
An impatient mind is merely insecure:
_Restraint_ is the ultimate test of will.

The highest vigilance is demanded
Not by addition, but by _subtraction_;
A tireless and unceasing will to perfection.
All else is laziness.

Therefore the task of the creator
Lies not so much in intellectual capacity,
As in the boundless energy of the body,
And in the spirit.
