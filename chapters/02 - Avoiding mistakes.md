# 02 :: Avoiding mistakes

Avoiding mistakes is less expensive
Than careless execution.
A lack of foresight is not virtue—
And ignorance no excuse for bad decisions.

Complexity compounds
Beyond the scope of comprehension,
If not diligently kept at bay
At every step.

But he who is so fearful
Of even one wrong turn,
Will also come to ruin—
So narrow is the path we tread.

In his excessive caution,
He will fail to see
Those opportunities and treasures
Laid by Fortune at his feet.
